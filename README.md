NIORA – Premium Jewelry E-commerce Design
Project Type: UI/UX Design
Tools Used: Figma

Project Overview

NIORA is a fictional luxury jewelry brand centered around the themes of luxury, love, and trust. I designed a responsive homepage and product detail page that reflect this identity through elegant visuals, timeless typography, and intuitive user experience. The design combines emotional appeal with premium presentation, catering to users who value quality and aesthetics.
